# Flex Sensor Music Glove Instrument

A musical instrument consisting of flex sensors mounted onto the fingers of a glove. 
Hardware consists of the flex sensor glove, a circuit board and an Aruino UNO Microcontroller.
Software consists of a mix between JUCE, Faust and Arduino IDE. 

You interact with the program by using the mouse and bending the fingers of the glove to play the musical notes shown on screen.
